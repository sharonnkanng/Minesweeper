# MineSweeper

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Kotlin for Android development.    
The game consists of a grid of cells where the player must uncover all cells that do not contain mines.    
The objective is to reveal all safe cells without detonating any mines. If the player clicks on a cell containing a mine, the game ends.

## Features
1. The game grid consists of a fixed size of 5x5 cells.
2. There are 3 randomly placed mines on the grid - the number of mines gets interactively updated.
3. The player can reveal cells by tapping on them.
4. If the revealed cell contains a mine, the game ends, and the mine explodes.
5. The player can restart the game by tapping on the reset button.
6. The game displays the number of mines remaining to be flagged.
7. The Facebook Shimmer Effect shows the tile of the game beautifully.
